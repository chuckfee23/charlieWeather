# charlieWeather

The charlieWeather app allows a user to search for any city in the United States and get the current weather (including Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity, and UV Index) while also providing an icon displaying the current conditions. It also allows the user to see the 5-day forecast for that city (with the same details excluding UV index).

Upon searching, the app also adds the user's prior searches to a list so that they can call back on that city's weather.

This application was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including Jquery).

The following image shows the application's functionality:
